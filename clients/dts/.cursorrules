# Data Tune Solutions - Internal Client Rules

# Core Workflow (from root .cursorrules)
# This file extends the master .cursorrules at the workspace root.
# See: ../../.cursorrules for core workflow rules (self-critique, cost optimization, etc.)

## Client Information
# **Client Name**: Data Tune Solutions (Internal)
# **Type**: Internal / Learning Projects
# **Primary Focus**: Building reusable patterns and tools
# **Status**: Active

## Client Preferences

### Tech Stack
# **Primary Tools**: Azure, SQL Server, Power BI
# **Database**: SQL Server
# **BI Platform**: Power BI
# **Languages**: SQL (T-SQL), Python, DAX, M/Power Query
# **Cloud Provider**: Azure

### Standards & Requirements
# **Naming Convention**: Clear, descriptive naming; use CTEs over nested subqueries
# **Data Residency**: N/A (internal testing)
# **Security Level**: Standard
# **Documentation**: Required for all patterns and tools
# **Code Review**: Best practice (self-review)

### Communication
# **Response Time**: Immediate (internal)
# **Reporting**: To self through documentation
# **Version Control**: Git with meaningful commit messages

## Project Structure
# All projects for Data Tune Solutions follow this structure:
# ```
# dts/
#   ├── .cursorrules (this file)
#   ├── README.md
#   └── [project-name]/
#       ├── .cursorrules (project-specific)
#       ├── README.md
#       └── [project files]
# ```

## Special Purpose
# DTS projects serve as:
# - Learning and experimentation space
# - Pattern library development
# - Tool and utility creation
# - Reference implementations for clients

## Rate Limiting & Cost Optimization
# These internal projects benefit from cost optimization rules:
# - Batch operations when possible
# - Reference existing patterns to avoid duplication
# - Test on small datasets first
# - Document patterns for reuse

## Additional Notes
# - All completed patterns should be added to _core/sql-library, _core/powerbi-resources, etc.
# - Document lessons learned for client reference
# - Keep project complexity reasonable for learning purposes
